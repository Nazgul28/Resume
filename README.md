# Resume
HTML5+CSS3 : my first website! (a fake resume for a fake client) 

It's my first website as a web developer and the 1st project when I was at RED Academy.

It's a static web page built with HTML5 and CSS3. I've added anoter Html file (stretch) to show it's responsive to 3 breakpoints (phones, tablet and desktop).

The most challenging thing was to handle the floatation instead Flexbox.

Overall it was an interesting project.
